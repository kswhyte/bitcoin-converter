# Bitcoin Converter

Huey, Luey, and Duey need Bitcoins converted to different currencies. This web app converts Bitcoins to Etherium, Litecoin, and DASH using 3 APIs: BTC-E, Poloniex, and CoinCap with a React front-end and Node.js back-end.

## Use Case:
Donald wants to give each of his three kids, Huey, Luey, and Duey, birthday presents. He intends to give each of his children 5 Bitcoin each. The problem is that each of his kids has requested different coin currencies. Huey wants Ethereum. Luey is all about Litecoin. Duey is gloating about being into DASH. Donald wants to get the best rates possible when he converts the coins to give his children and wants a tool to calculate that for him.

Because Donald doesn't believe in alt coins and will live and die by Bitcoin, he also wants to set up a savings account of Bitcoin for each of his children to get when they are of age. The problem is that none of his kids have Bitcoin accounts and are confused by wallets.

#### Challenge #1:
Write a web app using nodeJS as the backend and reactJS as the client portal that will find out what the best exchanges would be for each of these trades. The app should talk to the BTC-E, Poloniex, and CoinCap APIâ€™s to get real data.

#### Challenge #2:
Store the pricing data inside MongoDB using Mongoose for querying data, showing trends, and displaying charts.

#### Challenge #3:
Install and configure bitcoind to create 3 Bitcoin addresses to send funds into.
